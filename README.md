Implementation of Layer 4 Load Balancer for HTTP Backend Service | Springboot, Remote servers,Round Robin
• I deployed Spring Boot-based HTTP Backend Services on remote servers, demonstrating proficiency in Java
development and server deployment. Engineered a TCP socket-based Layer 4 Load Balancer using a
round-robin algorithm, ensuring equitable load distribution and enhanced scalability.
• Customized the Load Balancer to facilitate byte-by-byte data transfer, optimizing communication between clients
and backend servers for efficient data handling. Leveraged Spring Boot’s robustness to design a multi-threaded Load
Balancer, enabling concurrent request handling and boosting overall system performance.
